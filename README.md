# Weather-App
Simple Weather app by ChatGPT and modified by Slend. Uses Weatherbit API.

If you want to download this and use it locally, you'll need to get a [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) API key. Then, where it says `api_key = os.environ["api_key"]`, change that to `api_key = "Your_API_key_here"` and it should work.
Bear in mind the free tier is locked to 50 calls per day.

Feel free to download this as it's generated by ChatGPT and adapted a little by me.
